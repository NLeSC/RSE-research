People,High,Why do people become RSEs?  How do we highlight the importance of RSEs and of selecting an RSE career to potential candidates for RSE roles? What makes these careers attractive? What are the considerations RSEs take into account to decide to take a role (in academia vs outside of academia)? Salaries? Technology stack involved? Progression opportunities? ,"We need to understand how to attract good RSEs both in academia and outside academia.
Risk of losing the best RSEs to  other career roles (either in academia or industry). Knowing the motivations and reasons people took up RSE roles is important in keeping them happy in those roles.
Many get the RSE part ‘accidentally’ rather than by choice when they start a project.
Some people may become an RSE due to lack of other career options. Ensuring that there is high-quality software development to support the production of research outputs is increasingly important as research becomes evermore computationally focused - we need to be able to attract and retain the best candidates for RSE roles.",,

After 7 years of debates on the phase diagram of water, the source code of both labs were released and a bug was found in one of them. After fixing it, both softwares agreed on the phase diagram.
